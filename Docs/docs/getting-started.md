# Getting Started

To use MonkeyLoader mods or develop mods for Resonite using it, make sure you have installed the
[latest release](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.GamePacks.Resonite/releases/latest)
of the Resonite Game Pack for MonkeyLoader.

Afterwards, start by making your own repository based on the
[MonkeyLoader Mod Template for Resonite](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.ModTemplate)
and then continue with the [Introduction](introduction.md) after you've renamed everything for your new mod.
